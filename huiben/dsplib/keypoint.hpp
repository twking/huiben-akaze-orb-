 The Keypoint Class

 The class instance stores a keypoint, i.e. a point feature found by one of many available keypoint detectors, such as
 Harris corner detector, libakaze::FAST, libakaze::StarDetector, libakaze::SURF, libakaze::SIFT, libakaze::LDetector etc.

 The keypoint is characterized by the 2D position, scale
 (proportional to the diameter of the neighborhood that needs to be taken into account),
 orientation and some other parameters. The keypoint neighborhood is then analyzed by another algorithm that builds a descriptor
 (usually represented as a feature vector). The keypoints representing the same object in different images can then be matched using
 libakaze::KDTree or another method.
